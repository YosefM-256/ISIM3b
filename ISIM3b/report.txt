This version took out the 100 Ohms resistor in the collector and the 1K Ohms resistor in the base,
resulting in two saved ADCs.
This version also took out the NMOS transistor in the feedback of the 0 - 5V switch in the Emitter,
which resulted in the voltage floating and an update (ISIM 3b) being needed to fix that.
the circuit diagram in the software was updated to match the updates in the circuit.

Most of the op amps were updated - replaced by the versions we actually intend to use in the circuit.
The next update should fature: 
	-	a fix to the floating emitter problem
	-	measurements to indicate how accurate the measured quantities would have been in reality
